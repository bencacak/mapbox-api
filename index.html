            <img src="img/main.jpg" alt="Main Campus">
            <p>This is Clark College's main campus located just on the other side of Interstate 5 from Downtown Vancouver. Clark College occupies either side of a signifigant stretch of Fort Vancouver Way between Mill Plain and Fourth Plain. This is by far the largest of all Clark College Campuses, containing over 20 buildings that host a variety of classes and students services. This is my favorite location. </p>

            <p>Columbia Tech Center is what I would call Clark College's largest satellite campus. This can be found in Camas, Washington on the far east end of Mill Plain. Clark College at Columbia Tech Center offers a variety of programs to choose from. So if you live in East County, you won't have to drive far to get to class.</p>
